### 👋 Hi there, I'm Koushik Edla

I'm a passionate and curious learner exploring the world of software development. I enjoy building things that solve problems, simplify lives, or just make people say “wow.” Whether it's a simple UI or a complex application, I love turning ideas into reality through code.
